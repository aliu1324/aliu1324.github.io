              <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
              <h3>I. Characteristics of the Curriculum</h3>
              <p>Language is the most important form and medium of communication in human society, an important component of civilization. The use of language with aural, oral, writing, reading and literary activities in daily lives, work place and academic environment exists in every field of society.</p>
              <p>The Chinese language curriculum is a comprehensive and practical curriculum in learning the application of the mother tone. A combination of utility and humanities is a fundamental characteristic of the course. Students should utilize real-life scenarios to independently practice languages, cumulate language usage experiences, familiarize selves with the characteristics and patterns of the Chinese language, deepen understanding and appreciation of the language, develop languages skills, refine critical thinking skills, elevate personal virtues, raise the socialist values with Chinese characteristics, cultivate refined artistic appreciation and acquire broad cultural understanding along with recognition of multiculturalism.</p>
              <p>The standardized Chinese curriculum should, on the basis of the mandatory education, develop Chinese proficiency,  personal morale, literacy of sciences and humanities, foundation for comprehensive yet individualistic character of a learner for the sake of conserving and developing the Chinese culture, ethnic unity and national creativity.</p>
              <h3>II. Guiding Principles</h3>
              <p><strong>1. Foster character through virtues, strengthen cultural self confidence, fully embrace the morale building purpose of the curriculum</strong></p>
              <p>The Chinese language is the spiritual homeland of the Chinese people and the curriculum is naturally positioned to preserving and promoting Chinese e culture, revolutionary culture, progressive socialism, while developing cultural self confidence and cultural creativity.</p>
              <p>The curriculum, in accord with values of socialism with Chinese characteristics, must attempt to foster character through virtues, disseminate the Chinese spirit, educate with socialist core values, promote loyalty to to the Chinese civilisation, the motherland, the Chinese people, the Communist Party of China and a optimistic outlook on life and values, leading students to develop independent thinking and value systems, strengthen resolve for the historical responsibility of great revival of the Chinese people and a keen civic duty. Linking the curriculum to students' character development, the later should be lead to actively social participation and taught an understanding of nature, society, self and life planning, further embracing the comprehensive character building purpose of the curriculum.</p>
              <p><strong>2. Promote reform of the chinese language curriculum based on character building</strong></p>
              <p><u>Continue holistic education and promote cultural confidence</u></p>
              <p>As the education sector and the society progress, the Chinese language curriculum should place a greater emphasis on the character building. It is necessary to further revise the purpose and content to pursue the overt knowledge skills but emphasis more on the inert values, also to pay attention to the changes of an information ear; through reforms, students should experience various guides and cultivations in the curriculum, progressive merging and internalisation of comprehensive virtues to read them for the value system, moral character and habits of the modern society.</p>
              <p><u>With emphasis on principled education, further reforms of the Chinese language curriculum</u></p>
              <p>The curriculum should further lead students to attain language skills, cultivate sense of language, master  fundamentals of the language, foster healthy learning habits, improve ability to use the mother tongue. Language skills are closely linked to logics and the curriculum must teach reasoning skills; the curriculum is also a pathway to foster refined and individual tastes in art and culture where students should experience beauty in learning the language for creativity. Language is a mirror of social and cultural progress. Students should actively learn the noble Chinese traditional culture and revolutionary culture, absorbing the best of global cultures and contribute towards the building and promotion of socialism with Chinese characteristics.</p>
              <p><u>Promote practice of Chinese, changing the way students learn.</u></p>
              <p>As a curriculum that requires large amounts of practice, the curriculum should emphasize the importance of application. Since digital resources and real-life applications are abundant, the curriculum should increase the willingness of the students to learn and utilize Chinese through reading and analyzing, expressing and communicating, organizing and exploring, thus allowing them to become accustomed to the grammar and able to handle the language with greater confidence. This will train their abilities, developing ideas, habits, empathy, attitude and values along the way.</p>
              <p>The curriculum should also remain flexible to mentor the people that modern society needs. The student should be guided to notice and recognize sensitive questions in utilizing Chinese, and to discover innovative ways to express themselves and solve problems.</p>
              <p><u>Emphasize the flexibility of the curriculum based on time periods, making it open, diverse and disciplined. </u></p>
              <p>The standardized high-school Chinese curriculum should adapt to the many needs of society, and what students wish to learn. Carefully choose the learning contents, revolutionize the methods of leaning to ensure that every student acquires the necessary language abilities. It should help students recognize their current strengths and how their skill sets should develop from there, stimulating their interest and potential, allowing them to expand and express their individuality in a multi-cultural, multi-media platform.</p>
              <p>The standardized high-school Chinese curriculum should have a relatively fixed structure, but flexible mechanism in application.The teachers should find their own resources to carry out the curriculum in an innovative manner,  increasing their own abilities while embracing the new digital age, actively using new technology and methods to create an open, diverse and disciplined curriculum structure and allowing the student's character development and enhancement to keep up with the needs of society.</p>
              <br/>
              <p>Language is the most crucial media of communication and carrier of information for human society; and it is an irreplaceable part of our humanity. The use of language, including listening, speaking, reading, and writing, exists in every area of our society.</p>
              <p>Chinese Literature is a curriculum which teach the comprehensiveness and practical value of the use of Chinese. The combination of practice and humanity is the fundamental quality of this curriculum. The Chinese Literature curriculum should guide students, under real life conditions, to cumulate language use experience, build love and interpretations towards Chinese, and develop the ability to use Chinese through practice; meanwhile, it should help candidates to enrich their ability of critical thinking, thinking quality as well as their appreciations for arts and the core value of Socialism; their understanding of cultural knowledge, and the diversity of the Chinese culture.</p>

              <h2>Chapter 2: Subject qualities and curriculum objectives</h2>
              <h3>I. Subject Qualities</h3>
              <p>Subject qualities, or learning outcomes, refer to the values and abilities students cultivate through learning certain subjects. Learning outcomes in Chinese language and literature are cultivated through active engagement with course materials and can be applied in real-world contexts.

              <h2>Chapter 3: Curriculum Structure</h2>
              <h3>Design Basis</h3>
              <ol>
                  <li>Using the ideals of Socialism with Chinese characteristics, establish the grounds for fostering holistic yet individualistic development, catering to each students' needs.</li>
                  <li>Using the subject qualities and curriculum objectives, create “Learning Objective Groups” amongst students. Learning Objective Groups are responsible for organizing knowledge and learning materials, deciding on effective learning techniques, and guiding students to achieve the four learning outcomes. Students in Learning Objective Groups collaborate in their studies of a variety of texts, including those that fall in “contemporary media”, “traditional literature”, and “narrative” categories. Such collaboration aims to foster basic communication skills, inquisitive thinking, creativity, and cross-cultural interactions in the learning process.</li>
                  <li>“Self-directed learning”, “Collaboration”, and “Inquiry” are the three primary modes of learning Learning Objective Groups hope to achieve. Rather than helping students learn specific aspects of the Chinese curriculum in isolation, Learning Objective Groups instead strive for holistic development through fostering multi-dimensional growth in areas such as creative expression, cultural understanding, and communication skills.</li>
                  <li>Overall structure of the curriculum should reflect a degree of breadth of knowledge and opportunity for more depth. Different Learning Objective Groups are responsible for studying different material. As such, Learning Objective Groups are subdivided into those that study mandatory material and those that move on to study electives. Groups focusing on mandatory material should aim to achieve the four fundamental learning outcomes and consolidate a basic framework of knowledge in Chinese, hence establishing sufficient breadth of knowledge. Those focusing on electives are encouraged to dive deeper into different aspects of the subject depending on the students' interests and needs. Such learning process is thus both holistic and caters to the individual's needs.</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Structure</h3>
              <p>The Chinese curriculum for public high schools consist of compulsory, optional-compulsory, and elective courses. Each course category should consist of 7-9 Learning Objective Groups. Additionally, material regarding traditional Chinese culture, contemporary revolutionary culture, and Chinese socialist culture should be included in each of the course categories.</p>

              <h3>Academic credits and course selection</h3>
              <p>Regarding the distribution of academic credits, students are required to complete 8 credits worth of compulsory courses, 6 credits of optional-compulsory courses, and 12 credits of electives.</p>
              <p>For clarification, compulsory courses are, by definition, required for every high school student to take. Additionally, optional-compulsory courses are taken according to the students' personal interests and/or based on graduation requirements whereas electives can be freely chosen. For optional-compulsory and elective courses, instructors are encouraged to advise students based on how each student wishes to direct his/her personal learning.</p>
              <p>The credit weightings for Learning Objective Groups depend on the types of course taken, and are organized in the following table:</p>

                                        <p>The relationship between academic quality and test scores:</p>
                                        <p>The standard divides student results into five levels. Levels one and two are the standards for compulsory courses, Levels two and three are the standards for higher level courses, and level five is the standard for optional courses. Level two acts as a basis for high-school level Chinese tests, level four acts as a basis for the acceptance of students for higher level schools and level five acts as a basis for students with interest in Chinese courses, and the student’s success in the course should be considered by higher level schools.</p>

                                        <h3>On teaching</h3>
                                        <p><strong>1.Elaborate the unique purpose of the Chinese curriculum, and promote the development of students' ability of core Chinese usage ability.</strong></p>
                                        <p>The Chinese curriculum for normal high schools should focus on guiding the development of students'  emotions, stands, and values. Teachers should pay attention on the perspective of the educational contents to imbue and nurture the students with the Chinese curriculum. The instructor should respect the unique learning experience of the student and guide his/her students to be nurtured by the Chinese curriculum, gaining art appreciating experience, establishing a welly-established self-cultivation, and developing a morally acceptable set of values for the world, the life, and the individuality.</p>
                                        <p><strong>2.Fully understand the uniquenesses of the assignment groups, and neatly manage the relation between different *assignment* groups.</strong></p>
                                        <p>There are 18 assignment groups included in the normal Chinese curriculum. While each assignment group has its own purpose and content, all the assignment groups are entwined and logically connected. Teachers could be organized, stylistic, and creative in the lessons based on the characteristics of the assignment group, progress made by the students, and their own academic specialities. The educator should fully aware of the uniqueness of each assignment group as well as their functions and dispositions and neatly manage the relation between assignment groups to avoid any omission; bewared of the distinctions on the principle, presentation, and range of each assignment group and to avoid simple repetitions.</p>
                                        <p><strong>3.Create a comprehensive learning environment: promote individual, collaborative, and research learning skills.</strong></p>
                                        <p>Educators should pay attention on the changing in his/her students learning methods, designed learning activities, guide and organize, and examine students' learning outcomes. Depends on students needs, educators should establish a learning environment which can guide the students to participate throughly and meaningfully based on different assignment groups. Educators should help students breaking the barrier between Chinese and other subjects, and bring the Chinese curriculum into daily lives through these learning activities which comprise of cultures, ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, and usage of speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills. Reorganize and consolidate the curriculum: help students to turn knowledge into their skills, to apply their methods, emotions, attitudes and values into the learning process, by doing topic reading, comparison reading, topic learning and projective learning etc. therefore enhance students' ability of using Chinese.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Encourage students to, based on personal interests, capacities, and specialities, purposefully choosing their studying contents, developing self-monitory skill and learning management, to explore personal learning methods. Strictly follow the principles of the Chinese curriculum, and neatly manage the amount of output content without increasing the academic pressure blindly. Meanwhile, encourage students, in the realm of “possible” and interest, to reach for a higher standard.</p>
                                        <p>Protect the curiosity, passion for learning, encourage  personal reading, free expression, guiding them to experience of process of finding-solving problems, based on students' personal developments and characteristics. Promoting topic studies that are based on the assignment groups; organizing group projects, and communications based on language and culture, classic literary works, scientific essays, to encourage cooperations between students(any kind) and displaying and communicating studying results. Enhance teaching quality by using the appropriate technology. Teachers have to focus on leading students, on the foundation of self--learning , to learn, share, communicate, and collaborate, mastering different learning methods, and excelling on creativity and practical skills.</p>
                                        <p><strong>4.Manage core curriculum and optional units as an entirety; enhance the connection and similarities between courses.</strong></p>
                                        <p>The educator has to connect and reorganize the content of compulsory courses, optionally compulsory courses, and elective courses. Manage the relation between elective courses and compulsory courses while focus on the connection between the unique assignment groups for different type of courses.</p>
                                        <p>The compulsory course must be based on mutual foundations, focus on the accumulating daily linguistic knowledge, and build a solid foundation for elective courses. The education must focus on developing the basic usage of linguistic knowledge. thinking and deducing, reading and understanding of literary works, as well as culture, and creativity.</p>
                                        <p>Elective courses must emphasize the distinction and gradation of the course, encouraging individual explorations, and promoting students' potentials and interests. The class must bring students' ability of constructing and organizing language as well as critical thinking into a higher level. The optionally compulsory course has to focus on the “width” of the content while the elective course has to focus on the “depth” of the content.</p>
                                        <p><strong>5.Explore the shift of teaching method under this digitalized society.</strong></p>
                                        <p>Educators must not be content on Chinese educations, and worship no technology; educators must neatly manage the relation between digital technologies and Chinese curriculum, and use technologies appropriately. Educators have to create the appropriate content for Chinese curriculum, forming meaningful, interactive learning environments to help students devote themselves into practical Chinese; use technologies to polish in-class activities, guiding students to experience a diverse learning process, encouraging students to learn Chinese initiatively in the natural environment to realize the encoding an use of knowledge. Educators must explore progressively on the digitalization revolution of Chinese education based on the development of internet, contributing to the lessons, online and offline, with a learning environment that includes the internet. Further deduct the changes that must be made on teaching procedures, resource usage, educational support, and grading, exploring the appropriate teaching method in this digitalized world.</p>
                                        <p><strong>6.Develop the ability of initiating and designing courses while make improvements on courses.</strong></p>
                                        <p>Teachers should be aware of professional developments, trying to build educational communities; adopt and participate in the evolution of Chinese curriculum, learning, renewing, practicing, and improving the quality of education; be prepared to work with colleagues and students, and learn how to self reflecting through cooperative lesson preparations and case studies, to improve through teaching; follow the educational patterns in objective groups, consolidate lesson related resources, broaden the horizon of the students, and exceed daily efficiency; focus on the resources of the school/location and resources that revealed during the program, guide the students to discover real-life problems, working out activity topics, and enhance on the awareness of Chinese usage in various circumstances, improving Chinese ability in multiple aspects.</p>
                                        <h3>On grading</h3>
                                        <p><strong>1. Focus on the development of core values</strong></p>
                                        <p>The fundamental intention behind grading is to fully develop student's core values. Process of commenting should accompany the student's learning progress and be based around activities such as reading and understanding, expressing and communicating, and organizing and researching. Thus, fully investigate student's core value development progress in specific language learning environments and activities.</p>
                                        <p>The grading must functions as a mean to check, access, reflect, encourage, discriminate, and select, rather than just a process of selecting and discriminating. The grading process must not only focus on the learning result, but also the nature of the mean. Focus on guiding and encouraging self-learning through grading.</p>
                                        <p>Chinese teachers should purposefully use the process and result of grading to discover the characteristics and problems of the student meanwhile inciting the motivation for studying by proposing highly personalized suggestions.</p>
                                        <p><strong>2. Effectively utilize grouped study goals characteristics</strong></p>
                                        <p>Grading should address characteristics of  of target category. The focus and content of every category is distinctive while interconnected. Comments should project each focus while considering that connection in order to coherently provide grading in agreement with the target of each target category.</p>
                                        <p>Commentators should be aware of characteristics of the Chinese language practices and take notes on students' participation, unique mind set, communication, problem solving, and creative thinking capabilities to fairly record students' complete learning progress within each learning target category.</p>
                                        <p><strong>3. Encourage diversification when commenting</strong></p>
                                        <p>The Chinese grading should be direct to students while acknowledging their dominance in their Chinese career. Comments should emphasize on the self development process. On the basis of meeting elementary targets, comments should be personalized in area such as interests and performance to support different intended growth. When grading specific learning assignments, the Chinese instructor should provide detailed comments alongside with practicable directions to improve. Thus, guiding students through comments, adjustments to learning process, organizing learning methods, and setting learning targets.</p>
                                        <p><strong>4. Use the appropriate grading method</strong></p>
                                        <p>The core literacy should be assessed under the condition of Chinese assignment.</p>
